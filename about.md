Hello! I'm Samhi, an engineer and sound designer who specializes in audio programming and implementation. I'm currently studying Computer Science Games at the University of Southern California. Additionally I am pursuing a minor in Game Audio.

In my free time I enjoy reading, TTRPGs, Magic The Gathering, and 3D printing.
