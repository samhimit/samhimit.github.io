Marble Rivals is a marbles roguelike. Collect powerful marbles and use them to defeat your opponents at marbles. Go play the game [here](https://csci-526.github.io/main-team-second-chance/gold/).

This page is listed under other because I didn't do a ton of interesting engineering on the project but you should go play it [here](https://csci-526.github.io/main-team-second-chance/gold/). Seriously go play the game [here](https://csci-526.github.io/main-team-second-chance/gold/). This is probably the best game idea I have and ever will come up with.
