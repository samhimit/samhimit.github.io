[Picnic Pals!](https://samhi.itch.io/picnic-pals) is a 2D puzzle game where you control three bunnies. Utilize the *entire* keyboard to navigate obstacles and position your pals to solve geometric puzzles to collect all the carrots on screen in 39 unique levels.

***

### For this project I implemented:
* Unique controls mapping the keyboard to corresponding locations on the screen
* Various obstacles including worms, bouncers, and walls
* Collection system tracking which carrots and worms are within the collection area
* Level and Cutscene management
