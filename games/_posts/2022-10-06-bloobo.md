[Bloobo](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bloobo/id1636995011) is a high-speed physics puzzle game featuring a jiggly, subatomic protagonist. Roll along Lines, adjust Ejectors, set up Portals - and much more - to guide the Bloobos through each Test Environment. Beware of Hazards like the Blackhole and Annihilator though as they complicate your solutions.

### For this project I implemented:
* 200+ sound assets using a hybrid of Wwise and Unity's Sound System
* Multiple listener system to allow for smooth audio transitions
* Dynamic music system
* Optimized compression and soundbank loading system
* Voice over system supporting voice acting and typewriter sounds

## Dynamic Music

I did cool dynamic music show in this video. It was pretty sick and is based off the bloobo's velocity and if you are testing and also idling.

## Positional Listener System

I used Wwise's multipositional system to make it so we can only have the blackhole sounds be position and not make you motion sick.

## Compression and Memory Optimization

The game used to be 1.7GB which is insane that it is now 200MB. Crazy dude.
