[DuoQ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3677620/DuoQ/) is an FPS e-dating sim where you use your real life voice to work (and flirt) with Tala, a mysterious stranger met in the fictional FPS game To the Heart. Together you’ll solve co-op challenges, learn about her IRL life, and answer the question: is she into you?

DuoQ was developed as my capstone project at USC with contributions from over 50 students across USC, Otis, Berklee, and Cal State Fullerton. This page focuses on my technical contributions to the project, a full write up on my experience as a director coming Soon™.

***

### For this project I:
* Implemented the core voice input interaction system turning the player's microphone input into parsable callouts for Tala's AI systems
* Collaborated in making a custom GOAP solution to handle combat and puzzles
* Creating custom dialogue import tools to support fast iteration times
* Programatic interactive dialogue UI
