Type Quest is a multiplayer typing game developed by a team of seven. Play with up to three friends and take on a boss with your typing skills. Every correctly spelt word damages the boss. Defeat the boss before he kills your party. Stylize with various hats.

For the front end we utilized Unity and created a custom Java server as the backend. I worked primarily on the networked aspects of the game defining the packets we would use as well as writing the front end server connection code.

# For this project I implemented:
* Typing based attack system
* Animation system for characters and a boss
* .NET socket system to communicate with Java sever
* Cosmetic hat system
