[Animal Antics](https://moosesabharwal.itch.io/animal-antics) is a 2D point and click adventure game following Bear, a building manager to an apartment complex full of residents. Spy on your tenants and uncover their skeletons and learn about the complex web of relationships that is their lives. Make sure you also steal enough items so that Bear can pay their bills on time while not getting caught by the tenants.

Animal Antics was made in three days during USC MEGA's Newbies and Vets Game Jam 2022, and awarded Best Art out of 11 games.
