[Sorelle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916580/Sorelle/) is a whimsical 3D puzzle-platformer that immerses you in the magical seaside town of Isola Chiara. Play as sisters Alessandra, Bella, and Capri as you explore the magic of sisterhood in a puzzle-solving adventure to restore magic and save the summer festival.

### For this project I implemented:
* Character swapping between the three sisters
* Music management system allowing real-time tuning of sound effects to chord progressions
* Three unique abilities with dynamic musical elements
* Wwise integration for multi-positional sounds on Niagara particles
* 200+ lines of voice over with basic procedural animations
* Discord and Steam integration including full controller support and achievements
* Dynamic reverb system based off Tom Clancy's The Division 2
* Physics based collision audio
* Unique foley for each sister across different surfaces
* Musically synced credits sequence
* Dynamic music systems (progression based layering and a unique layers for each sister)
* Cutscene management system utilizing Unreal's Sequencer
