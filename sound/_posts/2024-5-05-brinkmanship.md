[Brinkmanship](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2858410/Brinkmanship/) is a first person sci-fi mystery about greed, manipulation, and trust. As a spaceborne colonist 20 years into your voyage youâ€™ve just discovered that your ship has secretly altered its heading. Your parents give you a gun. The ship goes into lockdown. What do you do? Who will you trust?

### For this project I:
* Designed and implemented a real-time cutscene using Wwise and Unity
* Created tools to automate implementation of 1900+ lines of voice over

## Ship Turning Sequence

In the bridge sequence of the game the player is given the oppurtunity to change the destination of the colony ship. To communicate how large the ship is and how important changing the ship's course is this sequence needed to be big and weighty. The ship's engines fire up with several layers originating from the back of the room. Creaks and rumbles and dynamically spawn around the player to create a more grounded experience than a prerendered track as the player can move around during this sequence.
