[Bloobo](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bloobo/id1636995011) is a high-speed physics puzzle game featuring a jiggly, subatomic protagonist. Roll along Lines, adjust Ejectors, set up Portals - and much more - to guide the Bloobos through each Test Environment. Beware of Hazards like the Blackhole and Annihilator though as they complicate your solutions.

### For this project I:
* Implemented 200+ sound assets using a combination of Wwise and Unity's Sound System
* Designed tool and cosmetic sounds
* Designed a multiple listener system to allow for smooth audio transitions
* Implemented a dynamic music system
* Optimized compression and soundbank loading system
* Created a voice over system supporting voice acting and typewriter sounds

## End of Level Flow

The end of level flow plays an important role in rewarding players for completing tests. The flow consists of three aspects: a level complete sound effect, a level grade sound effect, and a level grade musical stinger. Earlier implementations trigger these sounds concurrently without ducking the base music loop creating a muddied unsatisfying sound. To extend and elevate the feeling of sucess this flow was reworked. When a player completes a test, the music immediately ducks to nothing giving space for the level complete and musical grade stinger.  After the stinger the music loop fades back in at a lower volume until the player continues to the next level. The level grade sound effect was moved to the claim rewards button. These changes allow the player a moment to breathe after completing a level.

## Lighten and Thicken

To help accentuate the changes in Bloobo's properties when using the Lighten and Thicken tools I implemented a state based system to adjust Bloobo's bounce sounds based off of its physical properties.
