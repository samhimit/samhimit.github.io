[Last Broadcast](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508870/Last_Broadcast/) is a 3D narrative game set in a small radio station at the end of the world. Players assume the role of D-Jay, a charismatic radio host who is giving their last show as the sun turns red and the world burns down.

### For this project I:
* Implemented with Wwise:
  * 1300+ lines of voice over
  * Dynamic soundscapes
  * Player controlled music selector
* Designed 2 in-engine cutscenes
* Designed UI and SFX
* Cut and cleaned voice over

## Dynamic Destruction

In the final scene of the game the radio studio begins to fall apart due to earthquakes. Since our team decided to use in-engine cutscenes I needed to implement a dynamic system for the sound of the destruction. I used a system based off collisions of the various pieces of ceiling and their velocities to create dynamic destruction sounds that felt like they reacted to what was happening on the screen.
