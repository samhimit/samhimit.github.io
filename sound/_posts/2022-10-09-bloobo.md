[Bloobo](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bloobo/id1636995011) is a high-speed physics puzzle game featuring a jiggly, subatomic protagonist. Roll along Lines, adjust Ejectors, set up Portals - and much more - to guide the Bloobos through each Test Environment. Beware of Hazards like the Blackhole and Annihilator though as they complicate your solutions.

### For this project I:
* Implemented 200+ sound assets using a hybrid of Wwise and Unity's Sound System
* Designed tool and cosmetic sounds
* Designed a multiple listener system to allow for smooth audio transitions
* Implemented a dynamic music system
* Optimized compression and soundbank loading system
* Created a voice over system supporting voice acting and typewriter sounds
