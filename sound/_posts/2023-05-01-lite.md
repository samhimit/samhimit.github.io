Lite is physics inspired visual sequencer developed as a personal project. Particles of light are simulated creating sounds based of different physical properties including color and speed. Place various tools that alter the light particles and create interesting sounds.

## Features

### Tempo Synced Collisions

Lite uses tempo callbacks from Wwise to sync each particle's collision to a beat. This system also allows for the player to adjust the tempo. Super Sync takes this a step further and prevents particles from leaving collisions until a beat occurs.

### Color Absorption

When a particle collides with a colored barrier its color changes. Particles of different colors play different sounds and react to colored barriers differently.

### Entanglement

When a particle passes through the entangler it splits. This tool is based off quantum entanglement and follows the same physical principals conserving momentum between the two particles. If one particle hits a barrier, the other particle will react.
