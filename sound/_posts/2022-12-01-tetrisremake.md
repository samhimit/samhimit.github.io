As a personal project I did a sound redesign of Tetris integrating dynamic music with Wwise. This project features scales that modulate with the key of the music as you control the pieces. Various layers and stingers fade in and out as you play the game. The entire music experience builds and diminishes intensity dynamically as the player clears rows and stacks blocks.
